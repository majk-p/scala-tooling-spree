# Scala Tooling Spree

This repository hosts the landing page for Scala tooling spree initiative

## What is it?

🔄 A Scala Tooling Spree is a regular online event where people get together to improve the tools we use every day for Scala development.

⏱️ During each 2-hour session, you'll work in a small team with an experienced maintainer to fix bugs or add features to tools like Metals, Bloop, and scala-cli.

🚪 These events are perfect for anyone who wants to start contributing to Scala tooling. You don't need to be an expert - we'll help you get started!

🎯 Our main goal is to grow the number of people who can contribute to Scala tooling. The more contributors we have, the better our tools become for everyone.
